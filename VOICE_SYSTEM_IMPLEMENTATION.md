## Testing the Implementation 🧪

### **1. Voice Toggle Functionality**
```bash
# Navigate to any page and test voice toggle in header
# Should persist preference across page reloads
# Should announce activation when enabled
```

### **2. Auto-Play at Test Transitions**
```bash
# Enable voice toggle
# Start any cognitive or speech test
# Voice should auto-play at:
#   - Test start
#   - Section transitions  
#   - Recording states
#   - Completion messages
```

### **3. Fallback Behavior**
```bash
# Test with missing MP3 files
# Should gracefully fall back to browser TTS
# No errors or broken functionality
```

### **4. Language Switching**
```bash
# Test switching to different languages including Hinglish
# Voice files should attempt to load for selected language
# Fallback TTS should use appropriate language voice
```

## Technical Architecture 🏗️

### **Voice System Flow**
```
User enables voice toggle → 
Test transition occurs → 
TTSButton checks for local MP3 → 
File exists? → Play MP3 : Fallback to browser TTS → 
Provide user feedback
```
